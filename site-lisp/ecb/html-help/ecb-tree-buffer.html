<h4>Group ecb-tree-buffer</h4>

<p>This group contains general settings related to the tree-buffers of
ECB:

<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
Local hook running at the end of each tree-buffer creation. Every
function of this hook is called once without arguments direct after
creating a tree-buffer of ECB and it's local key-map. So for example a
function could be added which performs calls of <code>local-set-key</code>
to define new keybindings for EVERY tree-buffer.

<p>The following keys must not be rebind in all tree-buffers:
<ul>
<li><kbd>RET</kbd> and all combinations with <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
<li><kbd>TAB</kbd>
<li><code>C-t</code>

</tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
Primary- and secondary mouse button for using the ECB-buffers. A click
with the primary button causes the main effect in each ECB-buffer:

<ul>
<li>ECB Directories:
Expanding/collapsing nodes and displaying files in the ECB
Sources buffer.

<li>ECB sources/history:
Opening the file in that edit-window specified by the option
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>.

<li>ECB Methods:
Jumping to the method in that edit-window specified by the option
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>. 
</ul>

<p>A click with the primary mouse-button while the SHIFT-key is pressed called
the POWER-click and does the following (depending on the ECB-buffer where the
POWER-click occurs):

<ul>
<li>ECB Directories:
Refreshing the directory-contents-cache (see
<code>ecb-cache-directory-contents</code>).

<li>ECB sources/history:
Only displaying the source-contents in the method-buffer but not
displaying the source-file in the edit-window.

<li>ECB Methods:
Narrowing to the clicked method/variable/ect... (see
<code>ecb-tag-visit-post-actions</code>). This works only for semantic
supported sources but not for imenu- or etags-supported ones! 
</ul>

<p>In addition always the whole node-name is displayed in the minibuffer after a
POWER-click \(for this see also `ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer').

<p>The secondary mouse-button is for opening (jumping to) the file in
another edit-window (see the documentation
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>).

<p>The following combinations are possible:

<ul>
<li>primary: mouse-2, secondary: C-mouse-2 (means mouse-2 while CTRL-key is
pressed). This is the default setting. 
<li>primary: mouse-1, secondary: C-mouse-1
<li>primary: mouse-1, secondary: mouse-2
</ul>

<p>Please note: If the tree-buffers are used with the keyboard instead
with the mouse then <kbd>RET</kbd> is interpreted as primary mouse-button and
<kbd>C-RET</kbd> as secondary mouse-button!

<p>If you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and
activate ECB again to take effect

Node info to display in a tree-buffer. Define which node info should
displayed in a tree-buffer after mouse moving over the node or after a
shift click onto the node.

<p>For every tree-buffer you can define "when" node info should be
displayed:

<ul>
<li><code>always</code>:
Node info is displayed by moving with the mouse over a node. 
<li><code>if-too-long</code>:
Node info is only displayed by moving with the mouse over a node does
not fit into the window-width of the tree-buffer window. In the ECB
directories buffer this means also if a node is shortened or if the
node has an alias (see <code>ecb-source-path</code>). 
<li><code>shift-click</code>:
Node info is only displayed after a shift click with the primary mouse
button onto the node. 
<li><code>never</code>:
Node info is never displayed. 
</ul>

<p>For every tree-buffer you can define what info should be displayed:

<ul>
<li>Directory-buffer:
<ul>
<li><code>name</code>: Only the full node-name is displayed. 
<li><code>path</code>: The full-path of the node is displayed. 
</ul>

<li>Sources-buffer:
<ul>
<li><code>name</code>: Only the full node-name is displayed. 
<li><code>file-info</code>: File infos for this file are displayed. 
<li><code>file-info-full</code>: Fill infos incl. full path for this file are
displayed. 
</ul>
<li>History-buffer: see Directories-buffer. 
<li>Methods-buffer:
<ul>
<li><code>name</code>: Only the full node name is displayed. 
<li><code>name+type</code>: The full name + the type of the node (function, class,
variable) is displayed.

In which tree-buffers RET should finally select an edit-window. If one
of the symbols <code>ecb-directories-buffer-name</code>,
<code>ecb-sources-buffer-name</code>, <code>ecb-methods-buffer-name</code> or
<code>ecb-history-buffer-name</code> is contained in this list then hitting
RET in the associated tree-buffer selects as last action the right
edit-window otherwise only the right action is performed (opening a
new source, selecting a method etc.) but point stays in the
tree-buffer.

<p>A special remark for the <code>ecb-directories-buffer-name</code>: Of course
here the edit-window is only selected if the name of the current
layout is contained in <code>ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer</code>
or if the value of <code>ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer</code> is
'always and the hitted node represents a sourcefile (otherwise this
would not make any sense)!

<p>The setting in this option is only the default for each tree-buffer. 
With <code>ecb-toggle-RET-selects-edit-window</code> the behavior of RET can
be changed fast and easy in a tree-buffer without customizing this
option, but of course not for future Emacs sessions!

The style of the tree-buffers. 
There are three different styles available:

<p>Image-style (value <code>image</code>): Very nice and modern - just try it. 
For this style the options <code>ecb-tree-indent</code> and
<code>ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before</code> have no effect! Note: GNU Emacs
&lt;= 21.3.X for Windows does not support image-display so ECB uses
always 'ascii-guides even when here 'image is set!

<p>Ascii-style with guide-lines (value <code>ascii-guides</code>):
<br><pre>[-] ECB
 |  [+] code-save
 `- [-] ecb-images
     |  [-] directories
     |   |  [-] height-15
     |   |   |  * close.xpm
     |   |   |  * empty.xpm
     |   |   |  * leaf.xpm
     |   |   `- * open.xpm
     |   |  [+] height-17
     |   |  [+] height-19
     |   `- [+] height-21
     |  [x] history
     |  [x] methods
     `- [x] sources
</pre>

<p>Ascii-style without guide-lines (value <code>ascii-no-guides</code>) - this
is the style used by ECB &lt;= 1.96:
<br><pre>[-] ECB
    [+] code-save
    [-] ecb-images
        [-] directories
            [-] height-15
                * close.xpm
                * empty.xpm
                * leaf.xpm
                * open.xpm
            [+] height-17
            [+] height-19
            [+] height-21
        [x] history
        [x] methods
        [x] sources
</pre>

<p>With both ascii-styles the tree-layout can be affected with the
options <code>ecb-tree-indent</code> and
<code>ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before</code>.

<table width="95%" align="center">
<tr><td>
Scroll step for easy hor. scrolling via mouse-click in tree-buffers. 
XEmacs has horizontal scroll-bars so invisible parts beyond the right
window-border of a tree-buffer can always made visible very easy.

<p>GNU Emacs does not have hor. scroll-bars so especially with the mouse
it is quite impossible to scroll smoothly right and left. The
functions <code>scroll-left</code> and <code>scroll-right</code> can be annoying
and are also not bound to mouse-buttons.

<p>If this option is a positive integer S then in all ECB-tree-buffers
the keys <kbd>M-mouse-1</kbd> and <code>M-mouse-3</code> are bound to scrolling
left rsp. right with scroll-step S - clicking with <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> or
<kbd>mouse-2</kbd> onto the edge of the modeline has the same effect, i.e. 
if you click with mouse-1 onto the left (rsp right) edge of the
modeline you will scroll left (rsp. right).

<p>Additionally <code>C-M-mouse-1</code> and <code>C-M-mouse-3</code> are bound to
scrolling left rsp. right with scroll-step <code>window-width</code> - 2.

<p>Default is a scroll-step of 5. If the value is <code>nil</code> then no keys
for horizontal scrolling are bound.

Show the expand symbol before the items in a tree. When the
expand-symbol is located before the items then the tree looks like:

<br><pre>[-] ECB

        [-] directories
</pre>

<p>When located after then the tree looks like:

<br><pre>ECB [-]
  code-save [+]
  ecb-images [-]
    directories [-]
</pre>

<p>The after-example above use a value of 2 for <code>ecb-tree-indent</code>
whereas the before-example uses a value of 4.

<p>It is recommended to display the expand-symbol before because
otherwise it could be that with a deep nested item-structure with
and/or with long item-names (e.g. a deep directory-structure with some
long subdirectory-names) the expand-symbol is not visible in the
tree-buffer and the tree-buffer has to be horizontal scrolled to
expand an item.

Directories where the images for the tree-buffer can be found. 
This is a five-element list where:
<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>element: Default directory where the default images for the
tree-buffer can be found. It should contain an image for every name of
<code>tree-buffer-tree-image-names</code>. The name of an image-file must
be: "ecb-&lt;NAME of TREE-BUFFER-TREE-IMAGE-NAMES&gt;.&lt;ALLOWED
EXTENSIONS&gt;". 
<li>element: Directory for special images for the Directories-buffer. 
<li>element: Directory for special images for the Sources-buffer. 
<li>element: Directory for special images for the Methods-buffer. 
<li>element: Directory for special images for the History-buffer.
</ol>

<p>The directories of the element 2 - 5 are additional image-directories
which are searched first for images needed for the respective
tree-buffer. If the image can not be found in this directory then the
default-directory (1. element) is searched. If the image can't even
found there the related ascii-symbol is used.

<p>All but the first element (the default directory) can be nil.

<p>ECB comes with images in four diffenent heights - so for the most
senseful font-heights of a tree-buffer a fitting image-size should be
available. The images reside either in the subdirectory "ecb-images"
of the ECB-installation or - if ECB is installed as regular
XEmacs-package - in the ECB-etc data-directory.
