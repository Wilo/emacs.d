<h3>Maximizing the ECB windows</h3>

<p>To get a better overlook about the contents of a certain ECB-window
every ECB-window can be "maximized", means all other ECB-windows are
deleted so only the edit-window(s) and this maximized ECB-window are
visible (and maybe a compile-window if active). There are several ways
to do this:

<ul>
<li>Via the popup-menus of the ECB-windows

<li>Via the main "ECB"-menu and here "Display window maximized"

<li>Via calling the adviced version of
<code>delete-other-windows</code><a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a> (bound to <kbd>C-x 1</kbd>) in one of
the ECB windows.

<li>Via one of the commands <code>ecb-maximize-window-directories</code>,
<code>ecb-maximize-window-sources</code>, <code>ecb-maximize-window-methods</code>,
<code>ecb-maximize-window-history</code> or
<code>ecb-maximize-window-speedbar</code> or the bound short-cuts for those
commands.

<li>Via the new command <code>ecb-cycle-maximized-ecb-buffers</code> which
cycles through all ecb-buffers of current layout by maximizing exactly
one of the ecb-windows after every cycle-step.

<li>Via the option <code>ecb-maximize-ecb-window-after-selection</code> and then
just by selecting an ECB-window. "Deselecting" an ECB-window brings
back all ECB-windows of current layout.

<li>Via the default modeline-mechanisms for deleting other windows. GNU
Emacs binds <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> in its modeline to
<code>delete-other-window</code>. ECB now supports this mechanism by binding
a toggle-command to <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> in the modeline of each tree-buffer:
If all ECB-windows are visible then this command maximizes the current
tree-window and if current tree-window is maximized all ECB-windows
are displayed again. XEmacs binds a popup-menu with some window
commands to <kbd>button-3</kbd> in its modeline. ECB supports this
mechanism by replacing this menu by a menu which offers exactly 2
commands: Maximizing current tree-window and displaying all
ECB-windows. 
</ul>

<p>Minimizing such a maximized ECB-window, i.e. bringing back to its
original size, can simply be done by redrawing the layout via the
command <code>ecb-redraw-layout</code> (bound to <kbd>C-c . lr</kbd>).
